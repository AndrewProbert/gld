    <h1><br> How it Works</h1>
    <p1></p1>
    <p1>The website's decision to recommend buying a put or call option, or no position at all, is based on the analysis of several technical indicators. 
        These indicators are used to assess the current market conditions and provide an indication of the potential direction of the stock's price.<br> <br> </p1>
    <p1>The first indicator used is the Relative Strength Index (RSI), which measures the momentum of price movements. 
        A high RSI value indicates that the stock may be overbought, while a low RSI value suggests it may be oversold.<br> <br> </p1>
    <p1>The second indicator is the Simple Moving Average (SMA), which calculates the average price of the stock over a specified period. 
        By comparing the current price to the SMA, the website can identify trends and potential support or resistance levels.<br> <br> </p1>
    <p1>The third indicator is the Exponential Moving Average (EMA), which is similar to the SMA but places more weight on recent price data. 
        The EMA helps to identify short-term trends and potential price reversals.
        <br><br>  
    </p1>

    <p1>The fourth indicator is the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), which compares two EMAs of different periods. 
        The MACD line indicates the relationship between the short-term and long-term price trends, while the signal line provides insights into potential trend reversals.<br> <br> </p1>
    <p1>Based on the values of these indicators, the website assigns a confidence score to the recommendation. A positive score suggests a higher confidence in buying put options, indicating a potential downward movement in the stock's price. 
        Conversely, a negative score suggests a higher confidence in buying call options, indicating a potential upward movement. 
        If the confidence score is neutral (zero), no clear recommendation is provided.<br> <br> </p1>
    <p1>It's important to note that these technical indicators provide insights into past price movements and trends and do not guarantee future performance. 
        Additionally, the decision to buy put or call options should consider other factors such as fundamental analysis, market conditions, risk tolerance, and individual investment goals.<br> <br> </p1>
